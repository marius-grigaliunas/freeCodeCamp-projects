Project completed in 2 hours 7 minutes.

i learnt more about
    -DOM manipulation: createElement, createTextNode;
    -How to display new HTML elements
    -general understanding how to create an app like a music player with implementations of
play, pause, shuffle, next, previous;

It was hard to understand the displaying of new elements and sometimes getting elements.

NOTE: all HTML and CSS was provided by fcc, I only followed the JS guided lesson;
