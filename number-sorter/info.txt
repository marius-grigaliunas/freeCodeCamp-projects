Project completed in 1 hour 2 minutes

I finished the project fast, because I was already familiar with sorting algorithms.
Altough the teaching itself could have been better. It could have given more information
what happens after every step, more details about this topic, but then again these 
courses are meant to show how to code not the theory itself.
